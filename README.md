# I Love Exploit
This is the backdoor that I normally use for server exploits that I attack.

# Features
- Surfing in the target directory
- Falsify data, time, and several other meta
- Terminal (allows you to use the terminal and the server is entirely yours)
- Execute your custom PHP command.
- Encryption (No need to worry about decryption questions and encrypt everything already here, no more data hidden from you)
- Database (Connect to victim database more easily)
- Capture all sensitive or insensitive variables from the server.
- Create a fake email to the web admin? don't worry I have provided it. ;)
- Do you want to use a reverse shell or bind shell or just a cruiser package? all you can do with closed eyes.
- Task manager? as you wish to end any process that is holding you back.

# Installation
I think you understand enough about installation, you can use the tempering method, make use of file uploads or even social engineering.
